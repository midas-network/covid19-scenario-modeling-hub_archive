methods: Stochastic agent based model of North Carolina using data population and demographic at the census tract level.
modeling_NPI: NPIs are modeled as mask wearing which reduce infectivity and susceptibility 50%
compliance_NPI: Based on the agents urbanicty and time varying following masking compliance rates. We do not remove NPIs from final reading 
contact_tracing: "Not applicable"
testing: "Not applicable"
vaccine_efficacy_transmission: If the vaccine is effective for an agent (first or second dose), they are moved directly to the recovered state
vaccine_efficacy_delay: 14 day delay for the first dose, 14 day delay for the second dose.
vaccine_hesitancy: Vaccines are distributed based on previous and forecasted vaccine uptake by age. 
vaccine_immunity_duration: agents are assigned time to return to susceptible follow min(60 days, exp(4 or 10 month))
natural_immunity_duration: agents are assigned time to return to susceptible follow min(60 days, exp(4 or 10 month))
case_fatality_rate: 0.0101
infection_fatality_rate: 0.0066
asymptomatics: 0.33
age_groups: [0-4, 5-9, 10-19, 20-64, 65+]
importations: We assumed 10 importations per day per state seeded randomly.
confidence_interval_method:  Run 50 replications of each scenario and calculated confidence intervals for all collected data.
calibration:  Calibrated by fitting average (across all replications) current hospitalizations and cumulative deaths in North Carolina to observed instances.
spatial_structure: Census tracts of North Carolina are modeled. Agents remains commute to work between census tracts. All agents in a census tract
interact with each other via the community form of infections.
