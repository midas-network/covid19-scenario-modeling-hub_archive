team_model_designation: primary
methods: Uses SIKJalpha which models temporally varying infection, death, and hospitalization rates. Learning is performed by reducing the problem to multiple simple linear regression problems. Effects of variant and non-variant are modeled separately as competing contagions.
modeling_NPI: [Round 6_updated] Uses Cuebiq data to assess current contact scores. We assume that by the end of the projection, the contacts will linearly increase to the pre-pandemic contact scores for each state. Accordingly we increase the transmission rates throughout the projeciton period.
compliance_NPI: Directly modeling compliance as stated above, rather than separate NPIs and compliance.
contract_tracing: Not applicable.
testing: Not applicable.
vaccine_efficacy_transmission: As given by scenarios
vaccine_efficacy_delay: 14 days
vaccine_hesitancy: Sigmoid fitted separately to different age groups. Cumulative coverage is approximately equal to the provided guidelines (68% for low, 83% for high)
vaccine_immunity_duration: Permanent.
natural_immunity_duration: Permanent.
case_fatality_rate: Learned from recent data.
infection_fatality_rate: Learned from recent data.
asymptomatics: Using sero-prevelance data from the CDC. Note that this covers the currect cumulative fraction of unreported, untested, and asymptomatic.
age_groups: [1-4 ,	5-14 ,	15-24 ,	25-34 ,	35-44 ,	45-54 ,	55-64 ,	65-74 ,	75-84 ,	85+] The age group is used to capture the change in death and hospitalization rates in the future due to the vaccine
importations: Not applicable
confidence_interval_method: We generate multiple trajectories by (i) Uniform sampling of the recently seen infection rates, under-reporting/asymptomatic population, vaccine coverage, NPI uncertainties, and variant prevelance. (ii) For each of the above case trajectories, we use multiple possibilities of death and hospitalization rates that have been seen in the recent past. The above results in multiple points for each day. Quantiles are generated based on sampling among these points for each day.
calibration: No caliberation/manual-tuning other than the listed assumption and trivial settings: non-zero lag between infection and death.
spatial_structure: Not applicable.
team_funding: None
data_inputs: Cases and deaths - JHU, hospitalization - HHS time-series

methods_long: We use our own epidemic model called SI-kJalpha, preliminary version
  of which we have successfully used during DARPA Grand Challenge 2014. Our model
  can consider the effect of many complexities of the epidemic process and yet be
  simplified to a few parameters that are learned using fast linear regressions. Therefore,
  our approach can learn and generate forecasts extremely quickly. On a 2 core desktop
  machine, our approach takes only 3.18s to tune hyper-parameters, learn parameters
  and generate 100 days of forecasts of reported cases and deaths for all the states
  in the US. The total execution time for 184 countries is 11.83s and for more than
  3000 US counties is 30s. Despite being fast, the accuracy of our forecasts is
  on par with the state-of-the-art as demonstrated on the leaderboard page. at https://scc-usc.github.io/ReCOVER-COVID-19.
  Our model is able to quickly adapt to changing trends, and the variations in parameters
  during different times/policies allow us to forecast different scenarios such as
  what would happen if we were to disregard social distancing suggestions.
  For each state, we model hospitalizations as a separate compartment, as a linear 
  function of recent cases with heterogeneous rates. This means that for some 
  hyper-parameter J, those who were infected at time t-1 to t-J will have a separate 
  rate from those infected at t-(J+1) to t-2J, and so on. This is similar to how we 
  perform death forecasts. For long-term forecasts (more than a few days in the future), 
  the cases are forecasted first based on our SIkJalpha model, which forms the input to 
  hospitalization prediction. 
  While we account for changing trends by putting more emphasis on recently seen data, 
  we assume that the trends will remain the same in the future for our point forecasts. 
  Quantiles are generated by considering variations in the infection/fatality/hopsitalization
  over recent window. Effects of variant and non-variant are modeled separately as competing contagions
  after estimating prevalence using SGTF vs non-SGTF data.
