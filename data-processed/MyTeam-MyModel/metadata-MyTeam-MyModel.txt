methods_long: "State level - A basic AR-type time series model fit using lagged values of case 
  \ counts and deaths as features. No assumptions are made regarding reopening or governmental\
  \ interventions. The model is jointly fit across all 50 US states, after some time-alignment\
  \ is performed as a preprocessing step to facilitate comparison between states. Heavier\
  \ weight is placed on more recent training data, to account for nonstationarity in the\
  \ underlying process. A lasso penalty is added to induce variable selection and prevent\
  \ overfitting. Quantiles are computed using a residual (Gaussian) bootstrap, separately for\
  \ each location.\
  \ County level - A quantile regression model fit jointly across selected counties using (1) \
  \ case counts, (2) self-reported COVID symptom rates, (3) doctor's visits rates related to \
  \ COVID symptoms, and (4) county population.  Features (1-3) are taken at various lags. \
  \ Furthermore, the slopes of features (1-3) are computed over the preceding month and \
  \ included in the model to provide a sense of the virus's momentum.  Signals (2-3) are \
  \ available as indicators through Delphi COVIDcast (http://covidcast.cmu.edu). Signal (2) \
  \ is administered with the support of Facebook. No assumptions are made regarding reopening \
  \ or governmental interventions."
