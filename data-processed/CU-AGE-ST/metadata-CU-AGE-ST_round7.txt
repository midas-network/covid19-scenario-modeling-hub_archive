methods: The metapopulation county-level SEIR model reproduces transmission within and between the 3142 counties in US. A model-filter framework assimilates daily county incidence of cases and updates the distribution of parameters and state variables at each time step. The inferred parameters and initial conditions are aggregated at the state level and combined with state-level information on population structure, age and state-specific seroprevalence estimates and published age-specific reporting, hospitalization and death rates. Then, to produce age-stratified projections, a second dynamical model, age and population- stratified, is initialized with the previously defined parameters and initial conditions. The age and population-stratified model is a SEIRV (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Vaccinated) compartmental model run in isolation for each of the 50 US states and DC. Here the population is stratified in 12 groups in order to reproduce different patterns of disease severity and vaccine prioritization. Specifically, in each state, the population is stratified by years of age (0 - 4, 5 - 17, 18 – 49, 50 - 64 and >65), adult exposure status (essential workers, healthcare workers, other adults) and health risk status (presence or absence of one or more health risk factors for severe disease). The model has a fall/winter seasonal forcing on R0 (+2%weekly from Sept 15th). Data inputs: JHU CSSE County-level confirmed cases, Safegraph mobility, CDC vaccination tracking (State), CDC SEROPREVALENCE data from Nationwide Commercial Laboratory Seroprevalence Survey (state, age groups), CDC line-list data for Case-hospitalization and Case-fatality rates, age distribution of recent infections from individual state departments (state, age groups), POLYMOD contact rates across age group in US.
Delta variant initial proportions are imposed by state using Nextstrain data from early July: https://nextstrain.org/sars-cov-2. To estimate the proportion of variant cases by time we imported time series generated with simplified state-level SI_1I_2R model with 2 strains (with no immune escape) and inference-model estimated susceptible population.

modeling_NPI: maximum relaxation reached.
vaccine_efficacy_transmission: Vaccine prevents infection with assigned VE (same effectiveness in preventing symptomatic disease). Vaccinated individuals have a reduced probability by (1-efficacy) of getting infected upon contact with infectious individuals.
vaccine_efficacy_delay: All individuals receive 2 doses. Efficacy imposed 2 weeks after first dose, 2 weeks after second dose.
vaccine_hesitancy: modeled on https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/indicator/?date=20210313&sensor=fb-survey-smoothed_covid_vaccinated_or_accept and https://data.cdc.gov/stories/s/Vaccine-Hesitancy-for-COVID-19/cnd2-a6zw. Across age group modeled using https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/interactive/household-pulse-survey-covid-19-vaccination-tracker.html
vaccine_immunity_duration: No waning
natural_immunity_duration: No waning
case_fatality_rate: CDC line-list data, JHU CSSE County-level confirmed deaths
asymptomatics: infections divided into ascertained/not ascertained. Ascertainment rate is inferred by the model.
age_groups: (0 - 4, 5 - 17, 18 – 49, 50 - 64 and >65)
